## My process
I started out with css because I am a visual person so i need to see what I'm creating.
Once I had the card outline build I began with inputing the nft picture and all of the text.
Then all the colors were added and I began the journey of getting all the elements just right and added my own flare to the card.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### Continued development

My confidence with css has risen a lot more after this project but I do want to continue learning css and even react.
